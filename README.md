# College Clustering
For this project, we will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

It is important to note, we have the labels for this dataset, but we will NOT use them for the KMeans clustering algorithm, because it is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

Also, the Kmeans algorithm under normal circumstances is used because you don't have labels. In this case, we will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed using the classification report and confusion matrix at the end of this project.
